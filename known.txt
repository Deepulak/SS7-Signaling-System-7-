digital-to-analog converters (DACs)

network interface device - NID


COs, also known as end offices (EOs), are centralized locations that include device
switches, multiplexers (MUXs) and demultiplexers (DEMUXs), Digital Access and
Crossconnect Systems (DACSs), and a wide variety of other equipment that is discussed in
detail later in the book.

However, the
recent developments in the area of digital technology, most notably synchronous optical
network (SONET) and synchronous digital hierarchy (SDH), have enabled service
providers to deploy fiber-optic trunks directly to IDLCs from the CO.

Some of the new services designed into the framework are Hybrid Fiber Coax (HFC),
xDSL, Fiber to the Curb, and the integration of ISDN equipment directly into the SLC. This
design set the pace for what is now called Next Generation-IDLC (NG-IDLC). GR-303-
CORE also specifies a set of standard deployment methodologies for bridging the gap
among vendors and technologies.

The three devices you see the most are the Service
Switching Point (SSP), Signal Transfer Point (STP), and the Service Control Point (SCP)

SSPs are switches that reside at service provider end offices (EOs) or central offices (COs)

ISUP Starting point


Two algorithms are in use today for error reduction in the quantizing phase:
• μ-Law (pronounced mu-law—also known as μ-255)—Used in North America and
Japan
• A-Law—Used in Europe and the rest of the world

The digital signal level 0 (DS-0)


There are 256 discrete values, 0 to 127 and –0 to –127. The actual zero signal level is not
represented. The first bit is the sign bit, which allows for a value of 0 with a negative sign
bit, basically –0, as the first value below the x-axis.
